# CGSolution
My solutions in C#, Java and C for CG algorithms


## Additional notes
Most solutions are in C or C#.

The C# solutions can be found in the CGCS/CS.Dev folder (the Cs.Solved folder is a "legacy" folder and thus to be deleted in the future)

The C solutions can be found in cgc/src folder
